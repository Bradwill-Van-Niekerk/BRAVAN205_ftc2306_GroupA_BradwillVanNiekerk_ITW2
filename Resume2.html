                I was a line attendent, therefor i was in charge of making sure the production line was running to taget, as well as find and report any defective or malformed bottles.
                Aside from that I was also required to make sure the line is clean of broken glass, as this could potenially lead to glass contaminating the glass that would be sent to clients.<br>
